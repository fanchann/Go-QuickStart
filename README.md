## Go QuickStart
This is a mold for creating the REST API that I use, no need to change the code for database settings, just change the .env in the environment folder for database settings, oh yeah for version 1.0 this only supports mysql, maybe in the future I will make it support all databases.

start with `go-start -pkg=awesomeProject` and see a miracle come out
